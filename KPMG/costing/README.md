## Costing 

#### Overview 
This is a plugin that allowed the Managerial Consulting Department at KPMG to model a client's spending on elements of their business
The model should be divided into 3 sections (listed from top to bottom): 
1. Business Layer 
   * Contains the different business departments, such as Sales and HR
2. Application Layer 
   * Contains all of the applications used by the business departments, such as ERP and CRM 
3. Technology Layer 
   * Contains all of the hardware/software components used by the applications, such Servers and Databases
The layers contain a mixture of fixed costs made within each layer and costs fed into from the previous layer. 
For example, an ERP system can have a fixed cost of $2000 and be fed in $1000 from using a certain percentage of the server. 
The top business layer therfore contains the total amount spent to maintain the whole department. 

There are no known bugs at this time, although this product was not fully tested before the end of the internship
