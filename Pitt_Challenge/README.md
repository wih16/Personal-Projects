## Pitt Challenge 

### My project from the 2017 Pitt Challenge Hackathon, called Meditrack

This website is intended for users to track their pill information so that between doctor's visits, they can remember their day-to-day responses to their medicine so that the doctor can make more informed medical decisions. It also provides a map of all nearby hosptials.
